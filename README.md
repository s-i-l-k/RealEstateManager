# RealEstateManager
My final project at Coders Lab course. Web application for landlords to manage real estates (apartments) for rent. 
Needs some improvement :)


## About a concept
My goal was to create an app, which I personally could use. The idea of going into real estates trade stemmed from my previous job experience and need to keep all information nearby, not looking in thick binders.
I should have cut the project a bit because of its assumed size, too big for first own project. It still has a few bugs and not everything looks and works perfectly. I will be developing it during next weeks. The most important thing to change is making a relational database.

## How it works
RealEstateManager works most of all with database queries. Originally I used JSON server to imitate REST API, but at the end I decided to move to Firebase and get to know this tool as well.
As an user you can:
* add, remove and edit real estates, tenants and vendors;
* get cards of real estates, tenants and vendors with all informations;
* contact tenant and vendor by phonecall, sms or email;
* be aware of overdue payments and check which payments are already made;
* make to-do-list for all or for selected real estate


## Used technologies/tools
* ReactJS
* Sass
* Webpack
* Firebase
